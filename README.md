# 📊 Customer Trends: End-to-End Data Analytics Pipeline

A full-cycle data project demonstrating the transition from **Raw Data Ingestion** to **Interactive Business Intelligence**. This repository showcases skills in Python ETL, SQL Database Management, and Power BI Storytelling.

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow
This project follows a professional data lifecycle:
1.  **Data Cleaning & EDA (Python/Jupyter):** Handled missing values, outliers, and data type normalization.
2.  **Database Integration (PostgreSQL):** Exported cleaned data into pgAdmin4 for structured querying.
3.  **Business Logic (SQL):** Authored complex queries to extract key performance indicators (KPIs).
4.  **Data Visualization (Power BI):** Connected the live SQL database to Power BI to build a dynamic dashboard.
5.  **Reporting:** Synthesized technical findings into a stakeholder-ready presentation.

## 📈 Future Automation Roadmap
I am currently refactoring this manual workflow into an automated pipeline:
- [ ] **Scripting:** Converting `.ipynb` cleaning logic into a modular `.py` script.
- [ ] **ORM Integration:** Using `SQLAlchemy` to push data directly from Python to PostgreSQL.
- [ ] **Scheduling:** Implementing a task scheduler to refresh the pipeline daily.
